# Introduction to Algorithms
My solutions to problems in the book Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition

The solutions are coded using the C programming language.

## Getting started

```console
rm -rf build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
(cd build && ctest --rerun-failed --output-on-failure)
```
